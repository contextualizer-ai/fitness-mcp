You have access to a comprehensive fitness MCP for Agrobacterium gene knockout analysis with advanced network analysis capabilities.

Demonstrate the full power of this MCP by performing the following analysis sequence:

1. Search for genes related to "ribosome" (limit to 2 results)
2. For the first gene found, get its fitness data and identify conditions where it shows strong effects
3. Find genes that are essential in stress conditions (limit to 2)
4. For one gene-condition pair with significant fitness effects, perform network expansion analysis
5. Search for modules related to "ribosome" (limit to 2)

Your output must be a single valid JSON object with exactly these top-level keys:
