You have access to a fitness MCP with advanced gene-condition network analysis capabilities for Agrobacterium research.

Perform a focused network analysis demonstration:

1. Find a gene with significant fitness effects using get_conditions_for_gene for gene "Atu4077"
2. Use the first condition from that result to perform expand_gene_condition_network analysis
3. Interpret the biological significance of the network expansion

Your output must be a single valid JSON object with these keys:

Focus on demonstrating how network analysis reveals functional relationships between genes and growth conditions.
